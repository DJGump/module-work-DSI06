    "As you may recall from the *Model preparation* module earlier in this program, a typical data science workflow (or pipeline) looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Data Science Workflow](assets/eda.png)\n",

    "When you're working with text, you need to modify the above process to account for the peculiarities of text data. Look at the modified diagram below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Data Preprocessing](assets/data_preprocessing.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, the three steps in the exploratory data analysis process still occur in the same sequence. But the feature-engineering step is modified slightly. Now, you'll go step by step through the data science workflow for working with text data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data cleaning:** Clean your data to remove the problematic parts. In this checkpoint, you will walk through the basic steps of data cleaning for text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data exploration:** Do some data exploration to get to know your data better. In this module, there won't be a separate checkpoint dedicated to this step. This is mainly because the data exploration checkpoints of the *Model preparation* module covered many techniques that you can also apply to text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Feature engineering:** The last step in data preprocessing is preparing the features that you'll use in the modeling phase. In this respect, text data is special, and it requires different methods for creating features that will be used in the modeling. In this step, you'll convert text data into numerical form; this process is also known as *language modeling*. The next three checkpoints focus on this step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the steps above are iterative, and you may need to go back when you feel it's necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've prepared your numerical features, then you can jump into the modeling phase and apply machine-learning techniques for different supervised and unsupervised tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this checkpoint, you'll learn about some data-cleaning methods for text data. You'll focus on methods that are specific to text data. Hence, you'll skip the common methods that are also relevant to numerical data; those techniques are covered in the *Model preparation* module. With this checkpoint, you'll also be introduced to the tools that you'll be using throughout the module. Specifically, you'll make use of two NLP packages: NLTK and spaCy. \n",
    "\n",
    "* As touched upon previously, NLTK is a seasoned package with rich functionality. It is highly customizable and contains many models that are useful for learning NLP but are no longer state of the art and aren't optimal for production code. \n",
    "\n",
    "* spaCy is almost the direct opposite. It doesn't offer many models; rather, it uses algorithms and methods that are currently considered state of the art. Note that using only a limited number of algorithms and models generates a tradeoff between flexibility and ease of use. And spaCy optimizes for ease of use rather than flexibility—which makes its usage much leaner. Furthermore, it's written in *Cython* (that is, the Python code that you write is translated into C), so it's considerably faster. Indeed, it's among the fastest NLP libraries available.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the rest of this module, the functionalities of NLTK and spaCy will be used interchangeably. Some functionalities are available in both packages, but you'll usually use a functionality from a single package."

    "Most of the time, you'll start with a raw dataset consisting of many documents. But in order to work on them, you need to organize the material in a convenient way. You also need to clean the noisy and problematic parts that can harm your analysis or increase computation time without any informational gain.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preparing the dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Organizing the material means preparing a dataset that you want to work with. Specifically, you want a tabular dataset where rows represent the observations and columns represent the features. For example, imagine that you have a dataset that consists of articles written by several authors, and your goal is to distinguish authors from their writing styles. In that case, you would want the articles and the associated authors to be represented in rows, with the article and the author stored in two columns. However, this is just an example; there are many possible use cases. Here are some other examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If your dataset consists of books with multiple chapters, and each chapter may be written by a different author, then you may need to represent chapters as rows.\n",

    "* If your aim is to summarize the articles, then you may need to derive the paragraphs from the articles and make each paragraph a row.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If you want to translate a language into another one, then you may need to prepare a dataset where two sentences from the two languages form a row.\n",

    "To get your dataset into the format that you need, start by cleaning your dataset. When it comes to text data, *cleaning* means a lot of things, and you shouldn't consider it too narrowly. Here are some common steps for cleaning text data:\n",
