    "As the diagram above shows, with this checkpoint, you'll start to explore how to convert text data into numerical form. This is the feature-engineering step that you need to do before feeding your data into any machine-learning algorithm. Converting text into numerical form is often called *language modeling* in NLP jargon, and it's one of the most active research areas in NLP. This process is called language modeling because of semantics; a good numerical representation of the text should be able to capture the meaning of the words and their relationships between each other. You'll learn about semantics in the next checkpoint. For now, you'll just focus on a simple way to represent words in numerical form.\n",
    "\n",
    "To accommodate the feature-generation techniques that you'll learn here and to see how they perform on a machine-learning task, you'll feed your new numerical features into some machine-learning algorithms. You'll also make some classifications to demonstrate the pros and cons of your feature-engineering methods. Hence, your first hands-on NLP application in this module will be *text classification*. \n",

You fill in this matrix by counting how many times each word appears in each observation. You then use those counts as features. \n",

In the jargon of scikit-learn, generating BoW features is called `CountVectorizer`, as you'll see shortly.

    "\n",
    "* N-gram models are considerably more sparse than single-word models. The two `vain` sentences above share four words (`she`, `in`, `vain`, `the`) but zero n-grams. Sparseness does mean that an n-gram model can be stored in a more memory-efficient way. For example, imagine a dict that only lists the n-grams that are present in each sentence, rather than a set of columns with `1` if an n-gram is present and `0` otherwise. But it also means that a larger corpus may be needed to detect any shared patterns across documents. In other words, n-gram models may need more documents before they start to give good results.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Single-word models are straightforward to implement, while models incorporating n-grams are more sensitive to fine distinctions of meaning. Which to choose depends on the goals of the NLP project and the tradeoffs in time and performance for the specific corpus that you are modeling."

The only thing that you need to do is to give a tuple of range as values to `ngram_range` (a parameter of `CountVectorizer`). As the code below demonstrates, you need to provide a value for the parameter `ngram_range=(2,2)` inside `CountVectorizer`. This means that the vectorizer will produce 2-gram features. If you were to give `ngram_range=(1,2)` as the value, then the vectorizer would produce both 1-gram and 2-gram features together. But don't do that just yet—that task will be saved for this checkpoint's assignment.\n",
