Data Distributions
```

####Choose 6 distributions from the list of random distributions available in NumPy, called "Distributions".

For each distribution:

1. Generate a random variable with 100 datapoints using the code distributionvar = np.random.distributionname([arguments], 100), replacing distributionvar with an appropriate variable name and distributionname with the name of the distribution you’ve chosen, and filling in the empty space in the parentheses with your chosen values for the appropriate parameters. If you feel uncertain about how to do this, go back to the “Other Distributions” assignment for examples of code to use as a starting point.

2. Graph the variable using a histogram.

3. Compute the mean and standard deviation and plot them as vertical lines on the histogram.

4. Evaluate whether the descriptive statistics provided useful information about the variable. Can you identify any common characteristics of the distributions that could be usefully described using the mean and/or standard deviation?
