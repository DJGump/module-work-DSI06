You want to measure the factors that affect the level of development in these countries. To this end, you decide to use per capita income as a proxy for the development level, which is defined as the national income divided by the population. You want to use some features in your dataset to predict per capita income. Is this task a classification or a regression task? Why?"

Perhaps for every hour a customer spends using a free IDE, this results in how much they pay for premium extensions. "
