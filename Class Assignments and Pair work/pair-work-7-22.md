# Pair Questions 7-22 

1. Explain the difference between an experiment and a trial.

An experiment is a repeatable procedure with defined outcomes, and a trial is a single performance of an experiment. An experiment could be tested a vaccine on a patient, and 100 patients would each receive a trial. 

2. Explain the difference between an outcome and an event?

An outcome is the result of a trial, while an event is a point of interest from the possible outcomes. We could roll a dice twice and take the sums, giving us outcomes from the sample space, but an interesting event could be when that sum is a prime number

3. Come up with a real world example of each perspective of probability (classical, empirical, and subjective) that was not mentioned in class.

The card games Texas Hold 'Em can illustrate the three probabilities. Classical probability dictates that certain hands are more or less likely. Having the cards for a royal flush is very unlikely, so one can use the "common sense" of classical probability to intuit another player is unlikely to have those cards. Empirical probability comes into play as more cards are flipped in the 'river'. As certain cards are revealed, the possibilities of strong hands change based on new knowledge. if a King, Jack, and Queen are flipped, one might begin to worry about a royal flush being on the table. Subjective probability is simple. One might feel unlucky, and estimate the possibility of winning as lower, or considering a lucky friend more likely to be holding an Ace or 10 to get the flush or straight. 

4. Explain the difference between descriptive and inferential statistics.

Descriptive statistics use known values to summarize information of a sample, be it mean, spread, or median. Inferential statistics uses the sample to attempt to gain insight into the population and estimate parameters (population stats). 

5. Explain the difference between frequentist and Bayesian statistics.

Broadly, frequentist statistics uses probability as a measure of frequency, while Bayesian statistics uses probaility to represent uncertainty. Bayesian accounts for uncertainty of parameters and can be updated with new information, while frequentist  make assumptions about the population to model it probabilistically. Frquentist probabilities rely on repeatable trials, while Bayesian will hypothesize a probability of a single event based on outside and collected information.
