# Git + GitHub + Thinkful Advice*

### Background

* I truly believe having (and posting about) my GitHub portfolio has been my biggest asset in my career.
* It's not just about what you can do; it's also about convincing someone else of what you can do.
* Saying you know Data Science and Python on a resume is not nearly as powerful as having projects in your portfolio to prove it (and this is a 2-for-1, because it also shows you know how to use git).  Some companies say they want someone with an advanced degree, but what they really mean is they want some proof that the person they hire knows advanced things; build this proof out in the open to start making your case of why you should be hired.

### FAQ**

#### "What should I as a learner do?"

* Use GitHub as much as you can during this course
* You are given many Python/SQL assignments; try and always have your assignment in a GitHub repo before declaring the assignment done.

#### "How should I structure my repos for Thinkful work?"

* Multiple ways, most important is to use a system that will let you find old assignments.
* Maybe a separate repo for assignments and pair work, maybe keep them in same repo.
* I would keep Capstone Projects in they're own repo

#### "How should I use repos for Capstone Projects?"

* Don't title the repo "Thinkful-Capstone-Project-1" but title it on the subject matter you're analyzing (think highbrow clickbait)
  * As a recruiter, are you more likely to click on something named "Thinkful-Capstone-Project-1" or "Predicting-Customer-Churn"
  * If you dont know the subject matter going in, remember repo names can be changed
* Put a little effort into your capstone project's README.md
  * This is good practice for thinking in a business presentation mindset.  What are the high points and how can I convey them?
  * Again, think recruiters/viewers.  Two examples below; which project gives you a more positive impression?
    * [Example 1](https://github.com/AdamSpannbauer/cv_intro)
      * Viewers would need to be knowledgable & motivated to find the good stuff in this repo.
    * [Example 2](https://github.com/AdamSpannbauer/r_regex_tester_app)
      * Viewers just need to scroll down to see an overview of the work.  The more technical & curious can click around further if they'd like.

#### "I don't feel comfortable showing others my work, what should I do?"

* You can make repos private to where only you and selected collaborators can see them.
* I understand this for a homework repo with a lot of scratch work, but don't hide all your work or else you dont have any proof to recruiters that you know how to use git (let alone python).

*This is Adam's personal views, but he really really believes in them and thinks he has some perspective on this matter that's worth sharing.

**No one really asked these questions yet, but I like how this header reads.
